# Matrix-Multiplication
matrix multiplication practice in every language I know

python_matrixmult.py: 
This program written in Python reads in two NxN matricies (whether they be entered manually or given through a text file) and computes the product of those two matricies multiplied together. 
In this I make the following assumptions:
- both matricies have the same dimensions (they are both NxN where N is the number of rows/columns)
- both matricies are square (number of rows and columns are the same)
- if the matricies are read from a text file, the text file has one value of the matrix on each line
